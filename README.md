To use the accurate data, please download it from CDIP website.

How to train the ml algorithms.

1) Run `python test_stuff.py 3` to get the parameters for the ml algorithms.
2) Use the best parameters used and put it in save_files.py. And, then run `python save_files.py 3` to save ml algorithms.
3) Run `python test.py filename` to run testing on the data. Note that the data should be in CDIP format for now.


Thanks,
Enjoy
